        <h1>The NBA's 3-Point Revolution</h1>

<p>In 1979, the NBA introdoced the 3-point line. That year, the league average for attempted 3-pointers was 227. The then San Diego CLippers led the league with 177 3-pointers made - as a team. Last season, 15 players made more than 177 threes.  </p>

        <h2>The 1979-1980 Hawks</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="ATL" data-season="1979-80"></div>

        <p>Since the creation of the three-point line, no team shot fewer threes than the 1979-1980 Hawks, who finished the season with only 75 attempts. That is less than one three-point attempt per game. In today's NBA, that would be a recipe for disaster. For context, last year the Timberwolves shot the fewest threes in the league with 601. But back in 1980 - the first year the three-point line was instituted - not shooting threes was a viable strategy. The 1079-1980 Hawks went 50-32.</p>


         <h2>The 2004-2005 Suns</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="PHO" data-season="2004-05"></div>

        <p>Arguably no team helped spark the threepoint revolution more than the 2004-2005 Suns, who are known as the "Seven Seconds or Less" Suns because they tried to take a shot within 7 seconds on every possession. They signed free agent point guard Steve Nash before the year and elevated Mike D'Antoni to head coach midway through the previous year, in what became a match made in heaven. Nash would go on to win back-to-back MVP awards, as the Suns easily led the league in scoring. 

        At the time, most teams played a slow, isolation style of basketball, where they gave the ball to their best player and let him attack his defender one-on-one. Whereas, the "Seven Seconds or Less" Suns relied more on ball movement and spacing and threes. Only one team in NBA history had attempted more threes at the time than the '04-05 Suns - the Mavericks 11 years earlier.  </p>


        <h2>The 1995-1996 Mavericks </h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="DAL" data-season="1994-95"></div>

        <p>Lost in history, the 1995-1996 Mavericks shattered the record for made and attempted threes. But their 3-point proficiency did not exactly translate into success. They finished the season 26-56. 18 games into the season, their leading scorer Jamal Mashburn suffered a season-ending injury. That, along with the lacking of a true post player, left the Mavericks with an offensive identity of launching threes. But, the Mavs' struggles had more to do with their defense than offense. The Mavs finished tied for 8th in scoring that season, despite having the 5th worst record in the league. Meanwhile, their defense was the worst in the entire league.  </p>


        <h2>The 2015-2016 76ers</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="PHI" data-season="2015-16"></div>

        <p>The same season that the Warriors broke the single seasons wins record, the 76ers had the worst season of all time, not including seasons shortened by lockouts. The Sixers </p>

        <h2>The The 2015-2017 Warriors</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="GSW" data-season="2014-15,2015-16,2016-17"></div>

        <p>No team has had more success over the last three years than the Warriors, thanks in large part to their three-point proficiency. They have won 67, 73, and 67 games the last three seasons. Each of the past three years, the Warriors have finished in the top 30 all-time in three-point attempts and top 10 all-time in three-pointers made. Their backcourt of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson is responsible for most of their success from the perimeter. 

        When the Warriors broke the single season wins record two seasons ago, Curry broke the single season threes record, while Thompson finished the season with the fourth most ever threes in a season.    </p>
