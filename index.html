        <h1>The NBA's 3-Point Revolution</h1>

<p>In 1979, the NBA introduced the 3-point line. That year, the league average for attempted 3-pointers was 227. The San Diego (now Los Angeles) Clippers led the league with 177 3-pointers made - as a team. Last season, 15 players made more than 177 threes. Teams are shooting nearly ten times more 3-pointers per game today than they did when the 3-pointer was first introduced. Below, is a chart mapping out every single NBA since the 1979-1980 season, using data from Basketball Reference. The X-axis shows the number of 3-pointers attempted, and the Y-axis shows the team's winning percentage. The data points are different shades, depending on the year of the team. The darker the data point is, the more current the team. While the lighter the data point, the longer it has been since the team played.  </p>
        
        <div id="big-chart"></div>

        <p>Across the league, the number of 3-pointers attempted has increased every year for the past decade. Since 2000, 3-point attempts have doubled. Around that time, in Major League Baseball, a new movement known as "Moneyball" started to take hold. Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane sought to use more advanced stats to analyze baseball, rather than relying on conventional wisdom. Eventually, that kind of advanced analysis trickled into other sports.   </p>

        <!-- <div class="chart-container" id="chart"></div> -->

        <p>In the NBA, among other things, that meant more 3-pointers. After all, 3-pointers are worth 50% more than 2-pointers. The league average for 2-point shots is usually around 50%. That means every time you're expected to get one point for every 2-point attempt. To match that efficiency, teams only would need to make 33% of their 3-pointers, which is below the league average. </p>

        <p> Viewed another way: <p>
        <p> (2-point shot) X (50%) = 1 <p>
        <p> (3-point shot) X (33%) = 1 <p>
        <p> (3-point shot) X (35%) = 1.05 <p>
 
 

         <h2>The 1979-1980 Hawks</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="ATL" data-season="1979-80"></div>

        <p>Since the creation of the three-point line, no team shot fewer threes than the 1979-1980 Hawks, who finished the season with only 75 attempts. That is less than one three-point attempt per game. In today's NBA, that would be a recipe for disaster. For context, last year the Timberwolves shot the fewest threes in the league with 601. But back in 1980 - the first year the three-point line was instituted - not shooting threes was a viable strategy. The 1979-1980 Hawks went 50-32, winning their division, and finishing with the second best record in the Eastern Conference.</p>


         <h2>The 2004-2005 Suns</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="PHO" data-season="2004-05"></div>

        <p>Arguably no team helped spark the 3-point revolution more than the 2004-2005 Suns, who are known as the "Seven Seconds or Less" Suns because they tried to take a shot within 7 seconds on every possession. They signed free agent point guard Steve Nash before the year and elevated Mike D'Antoni to head coach midway through the previous year, in what became a match made in heaven. Nash would go on to win back-to-back MVP awards, as the Suns easily led the league in scoring. 

        At the time, most teams played a slow, isolation style of basketball, where they gave the ball to their best player and let him attack his defender one-on-one. Whereas, the "Seven Seconds or Less" Suns relied more on ball movement and spacing and threes. Only one team in NBA history had attempted more threes at the time than the '04-05 Suns - the Mavericks 11 years earlier.  </p>


        <h2>The 1995-1996 Mavericks </h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="DAL" data-season="1994-95"></div>

        <p>Lost in history, the 1995-1996 Mavericks shattered the record for made and attempted threes. But their 3-point proficiency did not exactly translate into success. They finished the season 26-56. 18 games into the season, their leading scorer Jamal Mashburn suffered a season-ending injury. That, along with the lacking of a true post player, left the Mavericks with an offensive identity of launching threes. But, the Mavs' struggles had more to do with their defense than offense. The Mavs finished tied for 8th in scoring that season, despite having the 5th worst record in the league. Meanwhile, their defense was the worst in the entire league.  </p>


        <h2>The 2015-2016 76ers</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="PHI" data-season="2015-16"></div>

        <p>The same season that the Warriors broke the single season wins record, the 76ers had the worst ever, not including seasons shortened by lockouts. The Sixers were inept on both sides of the floor, finishing with the league's second worst offense and defense. Poor personal, rather than strategy, was more responsible for their disastrous season. In an effort to "tank" - lose games on purpose so that they would receive a higher draft pick - the 76ers constructed one of the youngest rosters in the league, with only one player over the age of 30 playing meaningful minutes.   </p>

        <h2>The The 2015-2017 Warriors</h2>

        <div class="chart-container" data-team="GSW" data-season="2014-15,2015-16,2016-17"></div>

        <p>No team has had more success over the last three years than the Warriors, thanks in large part to their three-point proficiency. They have won 67, 73, and 67 games the last three seasons. Each of the past three years, the Warriors have finished in the top 30 all-time in three-point attempts and top 10 all-time in three-pointers made. Their backcourt of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson is responsible for most of their success from the perimeter. 

        When the Warriors broke the single season wins record two seasons ago, Curry broke the single season threes record, while Thompson finished the season with the fourth most ever threes in a season.    </p>
